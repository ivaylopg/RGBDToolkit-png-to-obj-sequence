RGBDToolkit-png-to-obj-sequence
===============================

Processing sketch to get an obj sequence of point clouds from the png images generated by RGBD Toolkit.

This sketch takes the PNG image sequence that comes out of RGBD Toolkit, converts it to (X,Y,Z) coordinates, draws a small cube at each point, and exports the pointcloud as an .obj file. It can either output an .obj sequence or a single frame.


Press 'q' while playing to create an .obj sequence or while paused to create a single .obj file. You must have the Nervous System "OBJExporter" Library by Jesse Louis-Rosenberg (http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/tools/obj/).

Make sure you have a good amount of memory allocated for Processing in the preferences if you will be using very long image sequences. If you find that it keeps running out of memory, try pausing playback while you're moving the camera around, and then start it again when you find a good angle.

Feel free to improve the code and make changes. Let me know if you have any questions.
